# Type Inference

## Avoid cluttering your code with inferable types

Declaring your number variable with its type or describing the type of an object when declaring it doesn't make sense at
all, instead it just adds noise.

```typescript
// Bad
let x: number = 12

// Good
let x = 12


//Bad
const person: {
  name: string
  born: {
    where: string
    when: string
  }
} = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  born: {
    where: 'Nigeria',
    when: 1969
  }
}

// Good
const person = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  born: {
    where: 'Nigeria',
    when: 1969
  }
}
```

What's true for objects is also true for arrays. TS has no trouble figuring out the return type of this function, based
on its inputs and operations.

```typescript
function square(nums: number[]) {
  return nums.map(x => x * x)
}

const squares = square([1, 2, 3, 4]) // Type is number[]
```

TS may even infer something more precise than what you expected at times.

```typescript
const axis1: string = 'x' // Type is string
const axis2 = 'y' // Type is "y"
```

Allowing types to be inferred can also facilitate refactoring. Say you have a **Product** type and a function to log it.

```typescript
interface Product {
  id: number
  name: string
  price: number
}

function logProduct(product: Product) {
  const id: number = product.id
  const name: string = product.name
  const price: number = product.price
  console.log(id, name, price)
}
```

At some point you learn that product IDs might have letters in them as well, and you change the type of **id** in
**Product** but this produces an error now (`Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'`).

A better implementation of `logProduct` would use destructing assignment:

```typescript
function logProduct(product: Product) {
  const {id, name, price} = product
  console.log(id, name, price)
}
```

In some situations, where TS doesn't have enough context to determine the type on its own, explicit type annotations are
welcomed.

Parameter types can usually be inferred when the function is used as a callback for a library with type declarations:

```typescript
app.get('/health', (request, response) => { // request is express.Request, response is express.Response
  response.send('OK')
})
```

There are a few situations, though, where you might still want to specify a type even if it can be inferred.
To enable excess property checking for an object literal for example.

Same goes for a function's return type. You may still want to annotate this even if it can be inferred to ensure that
implementation errors don't leak out into uses of the function.

When you annotate the return type, it keeps implementation errors from manifesting as errors in user code, helps with
presentation of the function's contract in general.


## Use different variables for different types

There's a key insight about variables in TS: __while a variable's value can change, its type generally does not__. The
one common way a type can change is to narrow, but this involves a type getting smaller, not expanding to include new
values.

```typescript
// Not so good
let id: string|number = "12-34-56"
fetchProduct(id)

id = 123456
fetchProductBySerialNumber(id)
```

When a union type does work, it may create more issues down the road. The better solution is to introduce a new variable

```typescript
const serial = 123456
fetchProductBySerialNumber(serial)
```

In general, try to avoid type-changing variables.


## Understanding type widening

At runtime every variable has a single value. But at static analysis time, a variable has a set of __possible values__ -
its type. When you declare a constant without a type, the type checker needs to decide on a set of possible values from
the single value specified â€“ this process is known as **__widening__**.

Suppose, you have a function to return the value of a 3D vector:

```typescript
interface Vector3 {
  x: number
  y: number
  z: number
}
function getComponents(vector: Vector3, axis: 'x' | 'y' | 'z') {
  return vector[axis]
}
```

But when you try to use it, TS flags an error:

```typescript
let x = 'x'
let vec = {x: 10, y: 20, z: 30}
getComponent(vec, x) // Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'x' | 'y' | 'z'
```

The issue is that `x`'s type is inferred as **string**, whereas the `getComponent` function expected a more specific
type for its second argument. This is widening at work.

This process is ambiguous in the sense that there are many possible types for any given value. In this statement, for
example:

```typescript
const mixed = ['x', 1]
```

there are at least 9 possible types that can annotate this constant. Without more context, TS has no way to know which
one is "right".

> TS gives you a few ways to control the process of widening.
> One is **const**. If you declare a variable with **const** instead of **let**, it gets a narrower type.

TS is trying to strike a balance between specificity and flexibility. It needs to infer a specific enough type to catch
errors, but not so specific that it creates false positives.

If you know better, there are a few ways to override TS's default behavior. One is to supply an explicit type.

Another is to provide additional context to the type checker (e.g. by passing the value as the parameter to a function).

Third way is with a **const** assertion. This is a purely type-level construct.

```typescript
const v1 = { x: 1, y: 2 } // Type is { x: number; y: number }
const v2 = { x: 1 as const, y: 2 } // Type is { x: 1; y: number }
```

When you write `as const` after a value, TS will infer the narrowest possible type for it. No widening.


## Understand type narrowing

The opposite of widening is narrowing. Perhaps the most common example of this is null checking. You can also narrow a
variable's type for the rest of a block by throwing or returning from a branch.

Using **instanceof** works as well. So does property checking. Some built-in function such as **Array**.`isArray` are
abel to narrow types.

Another common way to help the type checker narrow your types is by putting an explicit 'tag' on them:

```typescript
interface UploadEvent {
  type: 'upload'
  filename: string
  contents: string
}
interface DownloadEvent {
  type: 'upload'
  filename: string
}
type AppEvent = UploadEvent | DownloadEvent

function handleEvent(e: AppEvent) {
  switch (e.type) {
    case 'download':
      e // Type is DownloadEvent
      break
    case 'upload':
      e // Type is UploadEvent
      break
  }
}
```

This pattern is known as a "tagged union" or "discriminated union", and it is ubiquitous in TS.

You can also introduce a custom function to help TS figure out a type:

```typescript
function isInputElement(el: HTMLElement): el is HTMLInputElement {
  return 'value' in el
}

function getElementValue(el: HTMLElement) {
  if (isInputElement(el)) {
    el // type is HTMLInputElement
    return el.value
  }
  el // Type is HTMLElement
  return el.textContent
}
```
This is known as "user-defined type guard". The **el is HTMLInputElement** as a return type tells the type checker that
it can narrow the type of the parameter if the function returns true.
